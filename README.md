# Gif is Jif

Gif is Jif is a project that allows you to easily convert videos to gifs and webms.
It also has a built-in uploader for gfycat (unfortunately not Imgur because of technical limitations).
You can use it by running `create.sh` in bash. Note that it will only work in Bash. Not sh. Not zsh. Just bash.
